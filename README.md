This is sort of **Guideline** to help understanding S.O.L.I.D principles. None of this is new to software design,
but i found quite interesting to express such a principles in simple PHP notation within the context of real life examples.

We might find some worth mentioning concepts to Object Oriented Design as we go further in illustrating the benefits of S.O.L.I.D.
